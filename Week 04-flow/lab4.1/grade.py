# grade.py is a program that reads in a studentâ€™s percentage mark
# prints out corresponding the grade 
# the program confirms that the percentage is valid:
# Under 40% => Fail
# Between 40% and 49% => Pass
# Between 50% and 59% => Merit 2
# Between 60% and 69% => Merit 1
# Over 70% => Distinction
